## Overview 

Eatereez is a web application that provides pages to locate, rate, and view the menus of the restaurants and other food places on the UH Manoa campus. In addition, it will allow users to search for restaurants based on both meal preferences (e.g. burrito) and dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.).  It illustrates various technologies including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code. 
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

The web application is displayed here:

### Project Milestones

Eatereez has completed each of its milestones by the launch deadline, which are listed below
 
[Milestone 1](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez/projects/1) shows tasks finished for the project at the
 completion of the
 first milestone, which includes mockups of each of the project pages.

[Milestone 2](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez/projects/2) shows tasks that were finished for the
 second milestone of the project, which involves creating functional webpages for the website.

[Milestone 3](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez/projects/3) shows the tasks completed in the last milestone. This milestone's goal was to give the application an aesthetic touch which includes an overhaul of the landing page, restaurant page, and other small things. Included in our goals is to complete the implementation of the restaurant reviews and map. After some user reviews, a lot of functionality was added for the admin to be able to better control the website.

### Community Feedback

Jaylin Kuoha (Food loving Mathematics Major)
- Could use something extra to fill in the white space
- I like that there's a menu for each of the restaurants listed
- The colors are nice on the eyes

Matthew Mackenzie (At the time starving Geology Major)
- It's pretty impressive, but I don't like the green bar at the bottom having a bunch of white below it
- The logo is pretty gnar

Somebody
The homepage looks neat and clean, love the logo on the background.  However, the logo, search bar, and button seem off center. I really like the way the map looks but the links are broken and the “How To” section feels a little out of place.  I like having both the location and address listed.  I’d like that if i clicked on the menu or website link it would open in a new tab.   Loving the reviews! Wish I could sort by them.  Also I like the submit a restaurant page because there are so many sites that miss info and to be able to submit new info makes me feel good and not annoyed it’s missing something.
